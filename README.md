# Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

#In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.

**#Objectives:**

* List popular languages for Data Science
* List popular environment
* A table of data science
* Evaluating expresions in phyton

#Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:

languagelist = ("phyton", "R", "SQL")
print (languagelist)

#Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:

dslibraries = ("NumPy", "Pandas", "Matplotlib", "scikit", "ggplot")
print (dslibraries)

#a table of Data Science tools

df = data.frame(data_science_tools = c("RStudio", "VS Code", "JupyterLab")
              )

print(df)

### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python

#This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers
(3*4)+5

# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60
